This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Info

I built this app using a tutorial offered by [thejavascriptmastery](https://github.com/adrianhajdin)

It involves the display of information relating to covid 19 cases both globally and by country. It was created using React, MaterialUI, html5, and CSS.


The API used can be found [here](https://covid19.mathdro.id/api)
